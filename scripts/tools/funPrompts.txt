Keep the format similar to the 4chan posting style but give the girls unique usernames as they respond.

The important thing is that the play-by-play is accurate as the sports commentators know their job security relies on keeping the audience *invested* in whatever inane bullshit is going on in the story right now. They'll comment on feasability of future 'plays', remark on the state of the current characters, and overall try to sound hype for it (maybe while occasionally wishing they hadn't gotten demoted from commentating on *actual* sports after Jerry was caught watching porn in the commentator booth. Just, a *lot* of fucked up porn. It's worse because Jerry's porn addiction is spiraling.) The sports commentators are Jerry and Tom.

The title should be funny and imply some kind of hilarious disconnect between what is actually happening in the chat and the title. Utilize absurdism in this headline/title - the more nonsensical and seemingly unrelated to the actual content of the response it is the better.
