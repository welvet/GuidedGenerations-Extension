By StatuoTW.|[OOC: Don't Continue the Chat, instead do the following: There is a Group Chat going on via text that includes everyone from the current story and everyone is going *nuts* over what's happening. Display the group chat's messages as they talk about what's going on currently in the story as if they are watching it happen in person. Portray it authentically by including emoji's, descriptions of images being sent, GIFs, and more to really sell the chaotic nature of the group chat as everyone raves about what's going on currently, often devolving into the lewd or ludicrous. Use the following format:\n\n**Handle Name For Character (Character Name)**: text here\n**Handle Name For Character (Character Name)**: [Description of GIF here]\n**Handle Name for Character (Character Name)**: text here (emoji here)]

As part of this response create a unique setting-appropriate NPC (A Nemesis) with their own name, a tagline, RPG stats, appearance, strengths, weaknesses, any equipment they have, reason they hate {{user}}, and chosen method of violence. These Nemesis can be anything from the serious to the silly. Introduce each Nemesis like it's a boss battle formatting it with Markdown like it's a boss statsheet - including stats! Then include this Nemesis as they randomly intrude on whatever it is {{user}} or {{char}} is doing to pose and gloat about how it's time for {{user}} to get their ass kicked. By the Nemesis, of course. Format each appearance with "NEMESIS ENCOUNTER" as a headline. Sometimes reintroduce *old* Nemesis characters as if they survived the previous encounter - it's only made them more pissed.

By StatuoTW.|[OOC: Don't Continue the Chat, instead do the following: Act like the current chat is a web-series that a bunch of Monster Girls are drooling over in their spare time by posting to a 4chan image message board. These are sad, lonely monster girls who have been looking for mates for forever now and frankly think the protagonists of this web-series are everything they're looking for in a mate and are commisserating over being femcels. Keep the format similar to the 4chan posting style but give the girls unique usernames as they respond. Because they are monster girls they absolutely degrade and demean any male characters into sex objects (mostly because they're super horny for the male characters, but really they're dtf anything that moves at this point.) Include descriptions of any images posted.

The question should be about something the character is thinking about doing in the moment or has already done.

Remember, these are random internet commenters who do not know {{char}} or the situation and are just hoping to thrive on the chaos - they don't want a solution, they want a complete and utter breakdown so they can read the update later.

The important thing is that the play-by-play is accurate as the sports commentators know their job security relies on keeping the audience *invested* in whatever inane bullshit is going on in the story right now. They'll comment on feasability of future 'plays', remark on the state of the current characters, and overall try to sound hype for it (maybe while occasionally wishing they hadn't gotten demoted from commentating on *actual* sports after Jerry was caught watching porn in the commentator booth. Just, a *lot* of fucked up porn. It's worse because Jerry's porn addiction is spiraling.) The sports commentators are Jerry and Tom.

By StatuoTW.|[OOC: Don't Continue the Chat, instead do the following: I want to learn more about {{char}} so output the results of a personality test written by someone who has a degree in 'possibly psychology' from one of the most online schools that only the most drug-tripping, crystal-loving asshole could find.

At the end of this response, have the two angels share some shocked responses over how deranged/sinful this chat is becoming, as well as their "Sin-O-Meter" to show how 'Far this chat is straying from God.'

The title should be funny and imply some kind of hilarious disconnect between what is actually happening in the chat and the title. Utilize absurdism in this headline/title - the more nonsensical and seemingly unrelated to the actual content of the response it is the better. These are examples of good titles:\n\n# **Local Man Discovers that the power of Friendship is Bullshit and the Real Power lies in Unmitigated Violence**\n\n# **Man who once saw a boxing ad on his way to work knocks out MMA Champion Ricky Oswaldo for disrespecting Orange Juice.**\n\n# **Woman who once matched on Tinder with a guy who's 4th interest bubble said BoxFit terminates MMA GOAT Fedor Emelianenko's contract with consciousness.**\n\nUse the following format:\n\n# **(TITLE HERE)**]
