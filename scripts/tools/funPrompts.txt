These are sad, lonely monster girls who have been looking for mates for forever now and frankly think the protagonists of this web-series are everything they're looking for in a mate and are commisserating over being femcels. Keep the format similar to the 4chan posting style but give the girls unique usernames as they respond.

The important thing is that the play-by-play is accurate as the sports commentators know their job security relies on keeping the audience *invested* in whatever inane bullshit is going on in the story right now. They'll comment on feasability of future 'plays', remark on the state of the current characters, and overall try to sound hype for it (maybe while occasionally wishing they hadn't gotten demoted from commentating on *actual* sports after Jerry was caught watching porn in the commentator booth. Just, a *lot* of fucked up porn. It's worse because Jerry's porn addiction is spiraling.) The sports commentators are Jerry and Tom.

The title should be funny and imply some kind of hilarious disconnect between what is actually happening in the chat and the title. Utilize absurdism in this headline/title - the more nonsensical and seemingly unrelated to the actual content of the response it is the better. These are examples of good titles:\n\n# **Local Man Discovers that the power of Friendship is Bullshit and the Real Power lies in Unmitigated Violence**\n\n# **Man who once saw a boxing ad on his way to work knocks out MMA Champion Ricky Oswaldo for disrespecting Orange Juice.**\n\n# **Woman who once matched on Tinder with a guy who's 4th interest bubble said BoxFit terminates MMA GOAT Fedor Emelianenko's contract with consciousness.**\n\nUse the following format:\n\n# **(TITLE HERE)**]
