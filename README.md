## ⚙️ Settings

All extension settings are managed via SillyTavern’s Extension Settings panel:

- **Auto-Trigger**: toggle automatic execution of:
  - Thinking Guide
  - State Guide
  - Clothes Guide

- **Buttons Visibility**: show or hide action buttons:
  - 1st Person Impersonation (👤)
  - 2nd Person Impersonation (👥)
  - 3rd Person Impersonation (🗣️)
  - Guided Response (🐕)
  - Guided Swipe (👈)
  - Persistent Guides Menu (📖)

- **Injection Role**: select the role (`system`, `assistant`, or `user`) used when injecting instructions.

- **Debug Mode**: when enabled, shows detailed debug information in the browser console. Useful for troubleshooting but can clutter the console during normal use.

- **Presets**: for each guide/tool (Clothes, State, Thinking, Situational, Rules, Custom, Corrections, Spellchecker, Edit Intros, Impersonation 1st/2nd/3rd), choose any SillyTavern preset. Before running a guide/tool, the extension will switch to that preset (and its configured API/model), execute the action, then restore your previous preset—allowing different models per guide.

- **Prompt Overrides**: customize the raw prompt template for each guide/tool. Use `{{input}}` for your input text and other placeholders as supported. Overrides apply to:
  - Clothes Guide Prompt
  - State Guide Prompt
  - Thinking Guide Prompt
  - Situational Guide Prompt
  - Rules Guide Prompt
  - Corrections Prompt
  - Spellchecker Prompt
  - Impersonate 1st/2nd/3rd Person Prompts
  - Guided Response Prompt
  - Guided Swipe Prompt

## Troubleshooting

- **Missing Buttons:** Ensure SillyTavern is up to date (v1.12.9+) and LALib is installed/enabled.
- **Context Menus Not Appearing:** Try switching chats or re-adding the extension in the Quick Replies menu.
- **Other Issues:** Restart SillyTavern, check for updates, and consult the [SillyTavern documentation](https://github.com/SillyTavern/SillyTavern).
